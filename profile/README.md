## WorldSeed MMO

### About
This is an MMORPG engine built on [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom), an open source Minecraft server implementation. Some of the tools used to create the server will be open-sourced here.

The goal of this project is to create a game engine for Minecraft. Users will be able to easily create scalable MMORPG's with a web UI, a build server and a client plugin.

Players will be able to join and play without any client mods. Resource packs are automatically generated and set to the client on connection.
